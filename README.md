started with coding along with our livesissions and added on after that. Made a mistake of not thinking mobile first and ended up trying to make the site responsive in the end instead of from the beginning. Because of that i have i section in my css file with a media query with max width 767px that i cant get rid of without messing the whole layout. 
been reading alot in stackoverflow and w3schools.com.
For next project i need to make a more detailed plamn to begin with and think mobile first.
